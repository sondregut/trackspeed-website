      "howItWorks": {
        "question": "How does TrackSpeed work?",
        "answer": "TrackSpeed uses your phone's camera to detect when an athlete crosses the timing gate. The app uses camera-based motion detection to identify when the athlete's torso crosses the timing gate, providing millisecond-accurate timing."
      },
      "equipment": {
        "question": "Do I need special equipment?",
        "answer": "No! TrackSpeed works with just your phone. For split timing or start/finish gates, you can use two phones that sync together wirelessly."
      },
      "models": {
        "question": "What phone models are supported?",
        "answer": "TrackSpeed requires iOS 17 or later. For best performance, we recommend models with 120fps camera support."
      },
      "accuracy": {
        "question": "How accurate is the timing?",
        "answer": "TrackSpeed achieves ~4ms timing accuracy using sub-frame interpolation and rolling shutter correction. When using two devices, our clock synchronization ensures both gates are aligned for accurate split times."
      },
      "competitions": {
        "question": "Can I use TrackSpeed for official competitions?",
        "answer": "TrackSpeed is designed for training and unofficial timing. For official competitions, please use certified timing equipment as required by your sport's governing body."
      },
      "connecting": {
        "question": "How do I connect two phones together?",
        "answer": "Both devices need to have TrackSpeed installed. One device creates a session as the 'host,' and the other joins. The devices connect automatically via peer-to-peer networking - no internet connection required."
      },
      "cancel": {
        "question": "How do I cancel my subscription?",
        "answer": "Subscriptions are managed through your Apple ID. Go to Settings \u2192 [Your Name] \u2192 Subscriptions \u2192 TrackSpeed \u2192 Cancel Subscription."
