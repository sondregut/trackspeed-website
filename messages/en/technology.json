    "subFrame": {
      "title": "Sub-Frame Precision",
      "desc": "Athletes rarely cross the gate at the exact moment a frame is captured. Our system analyzes multiple frames to pinpoint the crossing moment between frames — achieving sub-millisecond interpolation accuracy that goes far beyond the camera's native frame interval."
    },
    "corrections": {
      "title": "Physics-Based Corrections",
      "desc": "Phone cameras scan each frame from top to bottom over several milliseconds, introducing a timing offset depending on where the athlete appears in frame. We automatically correct for this and other hardware-level timing artifacts to eliminate systematic error."
    },
    "clockSync": {
      "title": "Multi-Device Clock Sync",
      "desc": "When using two phones — one at the start and one at the finish — their clocks need to agree within milliseconds. Our synchronization protocol achieves ±3-5ms alignment between devices. During sync, keep both phones within about 10 meters of each other for best results. Once synced, move them as far apart as needed."

    "bodyTracking": {
      "title": "Body Tracking, Not Beam Breaking",
      "desc": "Laser gates trigger on whatever breaks the beam first — an outstretched arm, a knee, or the chest. This varies by running form and creates inconsistency. TrackSpeed tracks the chest crossing the line, matching how official timing works."
